Verse 1:
In the city of tomorrow, under neon's glow,
There's a figure like no other, with a spark and a glow.
Hot josket in the cosmos, with a vision so bright,
Creating worlds of wonder, with each touch of light.

宇宙中的热火，视野如此明亮，
用每一抹光创造奇迹的世界。

Oh, we're painting with the stars, in the dark of night,
With smoke and shadow, flame and light.
In a world where art and tech collide,
Hot josket, you're the artist's pride.

With a helmet clear and eyes so wide,
You see beyond what's on the outside.
In the dance of light, where dreams are spun,
You're the master of effects, second to none.

You make art from a simple spark.
Explosions of color, lights that bend,
In your world, all can transcend.

In the universe, you leave your mark.
Keep dreaming, keep creating, keep your art alive,
Hot josket, you're the one to survive.
